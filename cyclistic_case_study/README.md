### Case study: How does a bike-share navigate speedy success?

### About the company
Cyclistic, a Chicago-based bike-share program launched in 2016, has grown into a large-scale operation with 5,824 geotracked bicycles and 692 docking stations across the city. The company offers flexible pricing options—including single-ride, full-day, and annual memberships—which have helped attract a broad user base. Casual riders, who use single or day passes, represent a large portion of users, while annual members provide greater long-term profitability.

To support future growth, Cyclistic's strategy has shifted toward converting casual riders into annual members. This project explores historical bike trip data to uncover behavioral differences between these two rider types. The goal is to generate data-driven insights that inform targeted marketing strategies, identify patterns in user behavior, and ultimately help Cyclistic increase its annual membership base through more effective digital outreach.

### Background

A bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can't use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each day.

Moreno (Director of Marketing) has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. To do that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. Moreno and her team are interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.

### Analysis

To analyze the usage pattern of casual and annual members, historical data has been fetched from this [link](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html). This URL consists of 12 months' data of rides of both annual and casual members.
