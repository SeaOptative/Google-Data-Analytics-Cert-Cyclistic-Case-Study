### Case study: How does a bike-share navigate speedy success?

### About the company
Cyclistic, a Chicago-based bike-share program launched in 2016, has grown into a large-scale operation with 5,824 geotracked bicycles and 692 docking stations across the city. The company offers flexible pricing options—including single-ride, full-day, and annual memberships—which have helped attract a broad user base. Casual riders, who use single or day passes, represent a large portion of users, while annual members provide greater long-term profitability.

To support future growth, Cyclistic's strategy has shifted toward converting casual riders into annual members. This project explores historical bike trip data to uncover behavioral differences between these two rider types. The goal is to generate data-driven insights that inform targeted marketing strategies, identify patterns in user behavior, and ultimately help Cyclistic increase its annual membership base through more effective digital outreach.

### Background

Cyclistic distinguishes itself by providing an inclusive range of bicycles, including reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, catering to individuals with disabilities and those who cannot operate a conventional two-wheeled bicycle. While the majority of riders favor traditional bicycles, approximately 8% utilize the assistive options. Cyclistic users predominantly engage in recreational cycling, with a significant portion (30%) employing them for daily commuting purposes.

Moreno, the marketing director, has a big goal: she wants to turn casual riders into annual members. To do that, her marketing team needs to figure out how annual members and casual riders are different, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing. Moreno and her team are excited to dive into the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to find some trends.
